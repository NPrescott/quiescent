* Simplified static site generation
  I sometimes write about improvements or changes to /Static/:
    - [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2016/profiling-python.html][Profiling Python]]
    - [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2017/optimizing-static-site-generation.html][Optimizing Static Site Generation]]
    - [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2017/text-search-on-a-static-blog.html][Text Search on a Static Blog]]

** Things It Should Do or Does Already
   - [X] plaintext
   - [X] hierarchical directory/URL structure
     - e.g. (~<root URL>/2016/post-title.html~)
   - [X] RSS/Atom feed generation
   - [X] auto-generate an index page and list page

** Possible Future Improvements
   2) ~pip~ installable, or at least installation instrucitons
      + could be as simple as a real ~setup.py~ file

** Technology
  - [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][Jinja2]] for templating
  - [[https://github.com/lepture/mistune][Mistune for markdown parsing]]
  - Python 3.6 (for ~f~-string formatting)

** Things I don't care about
  - a local webserver
  - multiple input formats
  - comments
  - cross-post-to-twitter
  - tags, though there is a /tentative/ [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2017/text-search-on-a-static-blog.html][static search feature]] in a branch
