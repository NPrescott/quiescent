* Simplified static site generation
  I sometimes write about improvements or changes to /Static/:
    - [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2016/profiling-python.html][Profiling Python]]
    - [[https://idle.nprescott.com/2017/optimizing-static-site-generation.html][Optimizing Static Site Generation]]

** Things It Should Do or Does Already
   - [X] plaintext
   - [X] hierarchical directory/URL structure
     - e.g. (~<root URL>/2016/post-title.html~)
   - [X] RSS/Atom feed generation
     - 80% there, known issue of relative links in Atom feed (they're broken)
       - partial fixes include specifying a ~<base href="...">~ in a template
         or adding more explicity addressing to relative paths

** Possible Future Improvements
  - auto-generate an index/main page
  - installer / add-able to path in some fashion beyond invoking the script
    from within a virtualenv
    - could be as simple as a real ~setup.py~ file
   
** Technology
  - [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][Jinja2]] for templating
  - [[https://github.com/lepture/mistune][Mistune for markdown parsing]]
  - Python 3

** Things I don't care about
  - a local webserver
  - multiple input formats
  - comments
  - cross-post-to-twitter
  - tags
