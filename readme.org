* A static site generator that doesn't suck
  /where "doesn't suck" means tailored to my exact needs/

** Things It Should Do or Does Already
   - [X] plaintext
   - [X] hierarchical URL structure (to match the existing)
     - e.g. (~/2016/post-title~)
   - RSS/Atom feed generation
     - not 100% yet

** Possible Future Improvements
  - generate an index/main page
  - caching, to prevent regenerating files and needlessly shuffling around
    bulky post objects.
    - Maybe a plaintext file of "previously seen" posts?
      - "Clearing the cache" could be just deleting that file
  - installer / add-able to path in some fashion beyond invoking the script
    from within a virtualenv
   
** Technology
  - [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][Jinja2]] for templating
    - including ATOM/RSS
  - [[https://github.com/lepture/mistune][Mistune for markdown parsing]]
  - Python 3
    - 2 is dead, let it go.

** Things I don't care about
  - a local webserver
  - multiple input formats
  - comments
  - cross-post-to-twitter
  - tags
